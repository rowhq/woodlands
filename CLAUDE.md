## No-Stop Rule

IMPORTANT: Once you set yourself some todos, you should complete them without stopping, *unless* you have some particular *reason* to stop (e.g. you need to ask a question, you need feedback / input, etc.) If you do stop before finishing all todos, you MUST state the reason why you're stopping. We'll call this the "no-stop" rule. If you stop before finishing todos, and don't give any reason why you've stopped, I'll be very disappointed, and I'll ask you why you didn't follow the "no-stop rule."
